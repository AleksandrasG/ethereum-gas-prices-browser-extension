# Ethereum Gas Prices

Always up-to-date Ethereum gas prices from the 3 most popular data sources for Ethereum gas information: [Blocknative](https://www.blocknative.com/gas-estimator), [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/gastracker), and [EthGasStation](https://ethgasstation.info/). Right in your browser (available for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ethereum-gas-prices/njbclohenpagagafbmdipcdoogfpnfhp), [Brave](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ethereum-gas-prices/njbclohenpagagafbmdipcdoogfpnfhp), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/ethereum-gas-prices/)).

The badge displays the current gas price estimation for "normal" transaction speeds: not too slow, not too fast. This can be changed by clicking on any number in the table to set it as your preferred choice of <price provider + speed> to be displayed in the badge.

Clicking on the badge displays price estimations for different speed expectations ("slow", "normal", and "fast" transaction times). Each data provider has a different estimation according to their own calculation method. Blocknative uses memory pool information to make gas price estimations, while Etherscan and EthGasStation use on-chain block data, which is more of a lagging indicator.

Data from all providers is automatically refreshed every minute, and can be refreshed manually too.
